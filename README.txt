A collaboration project with Bob64 aka DustyBagel to help Technic and Elepower work together. Recipes were added for Technic machines to make some items from Elepower and for Elepower machines to make some items from Technic. A new electric converter will later be added to connect Technic and Elepower grids together. All content contained within is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.

IMPORTANT INFORMARION

If you decide to enable the setting that adds the power converter please note that it is still in development and is very broken. Only use it if you plan to give suggestions on how to make it better or if you want to request a feature be added to it. There are plans to give it a texture and clean up the fromspecs and fix it's many bugs.
