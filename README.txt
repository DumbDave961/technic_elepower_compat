A collaboration project with Bob64, also known as DustyBagel, to help Technic and Elepower work together. Recipes were added for Technic machines to make some items from Elepower, and for Elepower machines to make some items from Technic. A new electric converter will later be added to connect Technic and Elepower grids together. All content contained within is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

If you decide to enable the power converter, please note that it is not fully complete. I am pretty sure that it works, but bugs are possible. If you find a bug or have a feature request, then please make an issue on GitHub. 

There are also some duplication glitches that are a result of having Elepower and Technic modpacks together. There are plans to fix these if it is possible to do so.
